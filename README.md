## TODO:
- ~~Increase size of favicon with circular background~~
- Optimize index page image of myself in Ghana (it's really large and takes a while to load right now!)
- ~~Add funny Flappy Bird game of myself (and others) to site
- Consider converting backend from MongoDB to SQL
- Add Projects tab with 3D Print Previewer found at: https://codepen.io/akhil_001/pen/zoQdaO
